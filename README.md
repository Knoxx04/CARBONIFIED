# CARBONIFIED APP

## Description

        Carbon offsetting is the process of compensating for the emissions of 
        greenhouse gases by removing or reducing an equivalent amount from the 
        atmosphere. At Carbonified, we believe that this is a crucial step in 
        addressing climate change. We are committed to helping individuals, 
        businesses, and organizations offset their carbon emissions through 
        investments in renewable energy, reforestation, and other projects that 
        reduce or remove carbon from the atmosphere. Join us in the fight 
        against climate change and offset your carbon footprint with Carbonified.
